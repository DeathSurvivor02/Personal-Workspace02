This handout provides a brief overview of the Java syntax and conventions used in this course. It should be noted that not all of the keywords, available within Java,are described in this document.



Below compares the attributes associated with the programming languages C++ and Java

[Attribute-1][Object-Oriented Principles]

	[C++]
		Allows the programmer to mix procedural and obkect-oriented programming approaches
		this maintains backware compatibility with th eC programming language and its libraries

	[Java]
		Only an object-oriented progrmamming approach is allowed 
		As a result, global variables are not allowed


[Attribute-2][Speed]
	[C++]
		It is a compiled language and the resultant is executable is high optimised for speed
	[Java]
		it is an interpreted laguage and so there is the overhead of the interpretation stage before the software is executed
		This is generally nor noticeable bfor routine applications but can become an issue for specific types of software such as operating systems and real-time systems


[Attribute-3][Portability]
	[C++]
		The C++ programming language is designed to be used on any platform (operating system) but a compiler must be created for each platform
		As a result, for each new platform the program must be recompiled
	[Java]
		The Java programming language is interepreted and so is only compiled once to a specified format using byte codes
		On each platform, a Jav interpreter must be created but each interpreter can run the same compiler Java program
		Therefore, a Java program is only compiled once regardless of the number of platforms (operating systems) being used

[Attribute-4][Readability]
	[C++]
		Like C, C++ used hard to read operators to represent specific object-orented attributes
		These operators are used for a variety of purposeds (overloading), depending on the context.
		[example:]
			the ':' operator is used to signify one class inheriting from another. it is also used for other purposed in C++.
		
	[Java]
		Java uses distinct keywords that indicate their purpose. It avoids the overloading operators

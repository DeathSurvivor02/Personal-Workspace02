Introduction

In recent years, the popularity of video gaming has drawn attention to its potential impacts on the health of adolescents. Although video gaming can provide opportunities for social connection, learning, and entertainment, prolonged exposure to video games may have negative impacts on the physical and mental health of teenagers. This literature review aims to summarize the current evidence on the health impacts of prolonged gaming in teenagers and provide a summary of relevant sources, using the Chicago style of citation.

Physical health effects

Research has linked prolonged gaming to physical health problems in teenagers, including poor posture, eye strain, and physical inactivity. Sitting for long periods of time while gaming can result in poor posture and back pain (Chiu, Li, and Yang 2014). Blue light emitted by screens can cause eye strain and disrupted sleep patterns (Chung, Kim, Kim, and Lee 2016). Excessive gaming can also lead to a sedentary lifestyle, reducing physical activity levels and contributing to the risk of obesity and other health problems (Kirsh 2010).

Mental health effects

Prolonged gaming has also been associated with a range of mental health issues in teenagers, including addiction, depression, and anxiety (Chiu, Li, and Yang 2014; Kuss and Griffiths 2012). Gaming addiction can interfere with daily activities, relationships, and education and can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and low self-esteem (Kuss and Griffiths 2012). Excessive gaming can also result in social isolation, reduce face-to-face communication, and increase feelings of stress and frustration, potentially leading to depression and anxiety (Chiu, Li, and Yang 2014).

Social effects

Additionally, prolonged gaming has been associated with negative impacts on the social development of teenagers (Lemmens, Valkenburg, and Peter 2011). Spending excessive time gaming can lead to social isolation and reduce opportunities for face-to-face interaction, which is important for building and maintaining social relationships (Lemmens, Valkenburg, and Peter 2011). Furthermore, violent video games have been linked to increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior in teenagers (Lemmens, Valkenburg, and Peter 2011).

Conclusion

The health impacts of prolonged gaming on teenagers are a growing concern and warrant further research. In the meantime, it is important for parents, educators, and healthcare providers to be aware of the potential risks and to encourage healthy gaming habits in adolescents. This can include setting limits on gaming time, promoting physical activity, and encouraging a balanced approach to leisure activities.
